# ZMK Corne Config
This is my version of zmk config for corne. </br>
I've ordered my corne on keebd, so there are no additional pin for nice!view display and pretty defined acrylic case. Anyone with similar setup could find my config helpful, because I got some issues on my way.

## Features
- Separate builds for corne with nice!view display, and with LEDs strip+underglow
- Layer for soundpad
- My gaming layers

## Helpful tools I use
- [Keymap editor](https://nickcoutsos.github.io/keymap-editor) - can fetch your keymap from public repo and automaticaly update it.
- [Practice](https://www.keybr.com) - website to practice your new keymap.
- [Racing](https://data.typeracer.com) - website to race against other players, have a nice mode for programmers to practice special characters.
- [Keyboard checker](https://keyboard-test.space/) - website to check if all of the buttons works correctly.

## TODO
- Add custom 3d printed addon to acrylic case for better ergonomics.
- Customize nice!view widgets.
- Automatic layer visualisation in README
